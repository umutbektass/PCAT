"# PCAT" 
PCAT - My goal in the project is to create a gallery project where I perform CRUD operations using Node.js and MongoDB.

Add to card = On the Add to Cart page, we add our posts by selecting a title, description, and image file.

Delete photo = On the main page, we click on the post we want to delete and delete the post's image by clicking the 'delete photo' button, which deletes the file path from MongoDB and the folder where the post image was stored.

Update Photo = To update a post, we click the 'update photo' button and are directed to the 'photos/edit' page, where the current values are automatically populated into the input fields. We make the desired updates and click the 'save' button to complete the update process
